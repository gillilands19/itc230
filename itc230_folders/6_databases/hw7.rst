Assignment 7 - Using MongoDb with API's
####

Now that you've set up a MongoDb connection and a data model for your application, it's time to use these for real.

In this assignment, you'll update each application route to interact with your database instead of the in-memory array. So changes users make through your application UI will persist, even when the application is not in use.

Update each data-dependent route in your application to use the appropriate method of your data model. 

Note - several of your api routes (e.g. get item detail, update, delete) depend on matching a specific item. You'll need to decide which 'property' uniquely identifies an item. If you decide to key on the 'id' property auto-generated by MongoDb, remember to submit that value as part of your API request.
