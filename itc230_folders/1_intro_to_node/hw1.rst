Assignment #1
####
- Create a dedicated repo on https://github.com/
- Install Node.js on your development computer
- Create a basic server application with the following files in the root directory:

  - index.js 	- to launch the server and respond to requests
  - package.json 	- with information about your application

  And the following file in a ‘public’ sub-folder:
  
  - home.html 	- with any HTML you want to display for the home page

Your index.js should send different information for these scenarios:

- http://localhost:3000 		- returns the home.html page
- http://localhost:3000/about     - returns information about your app
- Returns a 404 status and error message for any other requests

Once ready, push these files to your github repo, and submit the main url of your github repo to Canvas.
